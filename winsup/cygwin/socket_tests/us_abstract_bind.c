/* Listing 57-8 */

/* us_abstract_bind.c

   Demonstrate how to bind a UNIX domain socket to a name in the
   Linux-specific abstract namespace.

   This program is Linux-specific.

   The first printing of the book used slightly different code. The code was
   correct, but could have been better (to understand why, see the errata
   for page 1176 of the book).  The old code is shown in comments below.
